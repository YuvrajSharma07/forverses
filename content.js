// Hi! My name is Varun Ahuja and I am the Co-founder of Forbidden Verses. I have been performing and organising spoken-word events for a while now and feel anything can be solved one poem at a time. Follow me on @alittlesomethingelse_ to chit chat about anything and everything.

// Hi I am Krishn Sharan, the Co-founder of Forbidden Verses. If we ever share a conversation, you'll either laugh or economics will take over you forever. Music gigs outside my future maggie stall cant be missed. The cost of knowing me is just one pepsi. I am omnipresent, however you can find me @hmm_acha_theek_hai

// hey, I'm Anureet. I handle marketing and curation at forbidden verses. I believe 'silence is an act of violence too'. Therefore I write, sometimes, very personal, sometimes very political, in my head they aren't that different. Follow my Instagram for poetry and memes

// My name is Anoushka Radhakrishnan and I am a member of the Forverses. I have been writing poetry ever since I can remember, (from the generic "my dream" in fifth grade to mental health and more now). I work to help create a space where people can be unrestrictive about their art and feel free to express themselves.

// Hi, I’m Vaibhav Sabharwal.I handle finance and logistics for forverses .I’m a Bcom hons student and feel that poetry and music really complete me. Follow me on insta to see random write ups based on my life.

// Hey, I'm Chetna, an artist (maybe). Stories are what inspires me to create something and I believe everything and everyone has a story of their own.
